review: |
  A book about the logistics and ethics of doing wildlife documentaries by a veteran to the business.

  A few interesting things to know about the industry around filming wildlife:

    * Many photographers and videographers use "game farms" who put animals out into wild looking areas for the duration of the shoot
    * Many videographers are highly motivated to get the perfect shot and jump into dangerous situations with little forethought 

  Examples of industry disasters:

    * Steve Irwin, the crocodile hunter
    * Timothy Treadwell, the grizzly man
    * Brady Barr bitten while chasing a python through a cave
