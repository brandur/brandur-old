review: |
  Story of the first Englishman to land in Japan based somewhat on history. Details the man's (a pilot named Blackthorne) exploits and involvement in a massive power struggle in Japan. The end of the book reveals the inner monologue of the man who would eventually become Shogun, and is worth reading the entire book for.
