review: |
  This book is a collection of the philosophies as written by the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (ruled A.D. 161-180). Certain of his revelations are profoundly enlightening and applicable to life in general. Unfortunately, these are somewhat overshadowed by the rambling tone and far less useful points that take up the majority of the book.
