review: |
  An Antarctic expedition discovers what might be the highest mountain chain in the world, and an abandoned city behind it. Some specimens of its inhabitants are discovered, but they revive and kill the team that found them. A lone pair of scientists enter the city and explore its depths. One of Lovecraft's best stories.
