  Details of the investigation into a paleontological site in Patagonia called Auca Mahuevo containing thousands of dinosaur eggs. Very interesting.

  * Involves the site called Auca Mahuevo in Argentina where thousands of sauropod eggs were discovered in 1997.
  * _Oviraptor_ means "egg seizer" and was named because its first skeleton was collected in 1923 from on top of a clutch of eggs that were assumed to be those of a plant-eating _Protoceratops_. Seventy years later it was discovered that those eggs were in fact those of an _oviraptor_: it was brooding over its own nest.
  * There are three kinds of eggshells: hard, flexible, and soft. Only hardshell eggs and a few flexible shell eggs have ever been found as fossils.
      * A few reptiles, such as sea turtles, some lizards, and snakes, lay flexible or soft-shelled eggs.
      * In dinosaurs, as well as most reptiles, the shell is primarily composed of hard mineral crystals called calcium carbonate--the same basic material that makes up limestone and cement.
      * Four categories of hard-shelled eggs: testudoid (some turtles), geckonoid (geckos), crocodiloid (crocodiles), and ornithoid (birds).
