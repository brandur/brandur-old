review: |
  Excellent book detailing the current state of power in the world, specifically the United States. It showcases nuclear energy prominently as the future of power, and explains why gas and coal will likely always play an important role in the grid (proponent of N2N, "natural gas to nuclear"). Green energy is covered in detail and shown to mostly be good meaning, but ultimately not practical for the real world. Conjectures are supported by hard facts and numbers throughout.
