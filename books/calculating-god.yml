review: |
  A novel about the arrival of an alien species on Earth. With the help of a local paleontologist, they determine that across three major alien worlds there have been simultaneous extinction events that helped guide the evolution of sentient beings. This, along with the fact that universal constants that appear to be tweaked exactly right seem to indicate the presence of God. 

  Well-written, but hard to figure out what point Sawyer was trying to make with the book (if any).
synopsis: |
  The end shows that races seem to have only a short period of technological progress because eventually they build themselves universal simulators and move their entire species into them and disappear. God (yes, in the book God turns out to exist) has guided the evolution of three sentient species so that they reach a technologically-advanced era at the same time and can meet each other. The races eventually travel to Betelgeuse and God combines their DNA to create the God for the next universal iteration (after the Big Crunch has occurred).
