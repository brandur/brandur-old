      * Chemicals
      * Wholesaling

      * Paper and forest products
      * Auto manufacturing
      * Restaurants
      * Appliance manufacturing
      * Trucking
      * Any manufacturing competing with China
      * Telecom services 
  * Money's value falls 90% every thirty years
  * From _Rules for Aging_ by Roger Rosenblatt:
      1. _Nobody is thinking about you:_ we spend time worrying that people hate us. Nobody is thinking about you. They are thinking about themselves--just like you.
      2. _Avoid swine_
      3. _Appearance is frequently reality_
      4. _Envy no one--ever_
      5. _After the age of thirty, it is unseemly to blame one's parents for one's life_
      6. _Never bring news of slander to a friend_
      7. _Never expect gratitude:_ extension of nobody's thinking about you. If you spend time thinking expecting praise, you'll end up burning energy fuming when it doesn't come.
  * China:
      1. Three hundred million rural Chinese will move to cities in the next fifteen years.
      2. GM expects the Chinese automobile market to be bigger than the US market by 2025.
      3. China has more speakers of English as a second language than America has native English speakers, and more Internet users than the United States. It has 320 million people under the age of fourteeen--more than the entire US population.
      4. China has more than three hundred biotech firms that operate unhindered by animal rights lobbies, religious groups, or ethical standards boards.
      5. On average, American companies make a 42% return on their China operations.
      6. Apparel workers in the US make $9.56 an hour. In El Salvador, they make $1.65. In China they make between 68 and 88 cents.
      7. There are 186 MBA programs in China. 
  * More observations from China:
      * China will build forty nuclear reactors over the next 15 years. This will increase nuclear market share from 2.4 to 5%. The average among nuclear-powered countries is 17%.
      * By 2020, autos on China's roads are expected to swell to one hundred million from 24 million today.
      * Coal supplies 70% of China's energy needs.
      * Market for diamond jewelry is about US$1.2B in China today. Fifth-largest consumer of diamonds in the world. The luxury-goods market in China is 11% of the global total.
      * Twenty million square miles of new apartment space were completed in Shanghai in 2004.
      * Currently 6300 active construction sites occupying 62 million square metres in Beijing.
  * Traditionally, 10 to 15% of money managers' assets were in gold or gold stocks.
  * One million lawyers in the US out of 300 million people. The US has 70% of all lawyers in the world, but has only 5% of the world's population. 
  * During the Japanese real estate bubble of the late 1980s and early 1990s, the land under Tokyo's Imperial Palace was said to be worth more than all the land in Florida. The average price of a 750-square-foot condominium in Tokyo rose to 70 million yen--about US$700,000.
