  review: |
    Brandon Sanderson's first novel detailing the political intrigue surrounding a country that was foremost in the entire world until the unexpected collapse of their crown city. The story has many great ideas and absolutely fearful villains, but it isn't quite enough to save it from two lead characters who are too flawless to be relatable. Prose is generally a little contrived with filler dispersed throughout for the purpose of fleshing it out to 600 pages.
  synopsis: |
    Prince Raoeden of Arelon is taken by the Shaod, a profound physical transforming whereby one becomes Elantrian. Since the fall of Elantris ten years prior along with the magic that held it together, the Shaod only partially transforms its subjects, leaving them in a semi-dead state where they cannot die, but whose wounds never heal. Sarene, Raoeden's political bride, arrives in Arelon to realize that her would-be husband is dead, and decides to focus her attention on thwarting the efforts of Hrathen, a high-ranking Shu Dereth priest, who attempts to convert the country before his religion's soldiers arrive to wipe it out.

    Raoeden eventually discovers that the Elantrian magic failed because of a chasm that opened in the landscape, and affected the ancient runes used to invoke the magic, which were based on the layout of the land. The monstrous forces of Shu Dereth attack Arelon, but Raoeden discovers how to complete the Shaod transformation, and the new Elantrians are able to drive off the attacking host.
